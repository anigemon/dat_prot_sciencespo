  <strong>Big Data - </strong> “Extremely large data sets that may be analysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behaviour and interactions.” (<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/big_data">Oxford Dictionary</a>)
  <mark>Controversy Point: Big data can highlight trends in information not visible indiscriminately, leading to developments in cures for diseases, understanding of traffic flows in megacities and social media relationships; however, big data can jeopardize individual privacy if data can be tied to an individual and issues surround ownership of monetization from big data analysis results.</mark>

                      <mark>Controversy Point: Encryption can protect individual communications so outsiders are unable to access conversations thus guaranteeing the right for privacy, but it can also protect criminals and terrorists from being spied on and ultimately arrested caught by national governments.</mark>

                      <strong><a href="terr_and_surv.html">Mass Surveillance</a> - </strong> “The subjection of a population or significant component of a group to indiscriminate monitoring. It involves a systematic interference with people's right to privacy. Any system that generates and collects data on individuals without attempting to limit the dataset to well-defined targeted individuals is a form of mass surveillance.” (<a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/52">Privacy <mark>International</a>) Controversy Point: Governments argue mass surveillance allows them to spot and stop terrorist organizations and criminal groups; however, issues arise of overreach, where individual privacy and discrimination of minorities are institutionalized by the government. Moreover, the efficiency of mass surveillance in preventing terrorist attacks is often questioned.</mark>

                      Controversy Point: Metadata can provide governments and companies information about how a certain tool or technology is being used and also help technical teams to intervene in case of a “bug”; but it can also put individuals at risk of their behavior exposed as only a few pieces of information about a user can reveal the individual behind the data.

                      <strong>Privacy -</strong> “Privacy enables us to create barriers and manage boundaries to protect ourselves from unwarranted interference in our lives, which allows us to negotiate who we are and how we want to interact with the world around us. Privacy helps us establish boundaries to limit who has access to our bodies, places and things, as well as our communications and our information.” (<a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/54">Privacy International</a>)

When used to track a suspect's cell phone, they also gather information about the phones of countless bystanders who happen to be nearby.” (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them?redirect=map/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them">ACLU</a>)
